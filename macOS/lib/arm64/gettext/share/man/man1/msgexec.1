Applies a command to all translations of a translation catalog.
The COMMAND can be any program that reads a translation from standard
input.  It is invoked once for each translation.  Its output becomes
msgexec's output.  msgexec's return code is the maximum return code
across all invocations.

null byte.  The output of "msgexec 0" is suitable as input for "xargs \fB\-0\fR".

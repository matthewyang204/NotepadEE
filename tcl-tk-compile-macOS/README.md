# Compiling tcl-tk for macOS
The contents of this folder allow you to either install a prebuilt copy of tcl-tk or build one yourself to install on your system with macOS High Sierra compatibility, as Homebrew's bottles are built for macOS Sonoma. The precompiled.zip contains an opt folder; drag the contents of the opt folder into your /opt folder to use. Otherwise, you can build one yourself from the tarball directly downloaded from gnu's site. Please follow the build notes.

Please resolve all deps yourself.

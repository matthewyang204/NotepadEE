# Deprecated Platforms
This branch hosts platforms that are no longer being actively maintained. Patches will be few and far between. Please do not rely on the code in these platforms as they will never be fully up-to-date.

-----
Windows
-----
**The Windows version is no longer supported as of Release v5.2.0. This is because being primarily a UNIX developer, I don't even have Windows systems. To do any testing or work on it, I have to use Wine, which screws up hours of my time. Additionally, I'm accustomed to using UNIX-only features and paths, which make the primary Linux codebase incredibly incompatible with Windows. Therefore, as a Windows user, you can just either get back to using vanilla Notepad or patch it yourself. You can still use old binaries as well.**

- Download the latest dev source code from the Windows section of this repository: https://github.com/matthewyang204/NotepadEE/tree/deprecated/Windows
- Binaries are next to all other binaries
- x64 binaries are provided for users, however, they are not signed
- Version compatibility:
- Windows XP or later; ARM64 systems need Win10 ARM64 or later
- Python 3.4 or later

Upgrading:
- You can directly run the new installer to upgrade. You can either download this from the Release of the new version or you can install from your custom-built installer.
